# Coding Interview Practices

Here are some good algorithm questions and coding challenges I've encountered during my recent job search. I don't always do well in technical interviews, because I'm better at the syntax and logic of a language than algorithms, so I try to practice some whenever I can (which is hard because I'm also on a new project at work). 4 years ago when I started looking for my first job (for new grads!), I don't remember receiving any coding challenge from Hacker Rank or elsewhere. Now they seem to be the norm as a first step for hiring. Those problems took away a lot of my nights and weekends between long runs and theater visits, but they are interesting! I actually love these coding challenges, especially the type of real world problems these companies are facing.

I don't want to expose the exact version of these problems, so the ones I posted here are heavily modified by myself in order to keep the original version confidential. Also not all of them are from companies, I've also searched online for interesting ones to practice.

Happy coding!
