# Coding Interview Practices

What a journey! After 3 wonderful years at [Dow Jones/The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/), I decided to take the next step of my career and join [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/). I have enjoyed my tenure at Dow Jones, and I appreciate having had the opportunity to work on many Wall Street Journal products. It was my fortune to start my career at such an amazing company and learn about the News/Online Media industry, and I would recommend the company to everyone.

This repo consists of some good interview questions I practiced and also some new technologies I've learned about during my interview process.
